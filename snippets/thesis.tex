% This snippet contains a few options for larger documents


%%% Preamble %%%

% Automatic new page before every section
\let\stdsection\section
\renewcommand\section{\clearpage\stdsection}

% Title page
% The titlepage environment puts the title on its own page while allowing you to add other stuff to it
% Another method is to add the option 'titlepage' to \documentclass, but that will put only \maketitle on the titlepage, and nothing else
\begin{titlepage}
	\maketitle

	% [Anything else you want to have on your titlepage]
\end{titlepage}


% Table of contents
{ 
\hypersetup{linkcolor=black} %To make sure that the links in the table of contents are black
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2} % To include only sections (level 1) and subsections (level 2) in the ToC
\tableofcontents
