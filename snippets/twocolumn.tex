% Preamble %
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[UKenglish, titlepage, twocolumn]{article}

%%% Margins %%%
% The default column separation is too small for my taste, so I slightly increase it here
% Comment the three commands below to revert the margins to their LaTeX defaults
% If you're curious about what these commands do to the layout exactly, add \addpackage{layout} to the preamble, and \layout to the main text to see a visual representation

% Increase the column separation by 10pt
\addtolength{\columnsep}{10pt}
% Compensate by pushing the whole text 5pt left
\addtolength{\hoffset}{-5pt}
% Compensate by adding 10pt to the total text width, effectively pushing both columns 5pt outward
\addtolength{\textwidth}{10pt}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Body text %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You don't require anything in your body text, two-column mode will automatically be enabled

%%% Switching modes %%%
% You can easily switch to single-column mode (for your table of contents, for example)
\onecolumn

% Switching back to two columns is just as easy
\twocolumn


%%% Full-width figures %%%

% If you want a figure to take up the entire textwidth and not just one column, add a * to the figure command
% This works for any figure type, whether it's images, tables or text!

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\begin{center}
		% You can specify the size of the image by setting 'width=' or 'height='
		% The size can be set absolutely (in px, cm, etc.), relatively (with 'scale=1.5') or relative to \textwidth, like done below
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image.png}
		\caption{A very beautiful image.}
		\label{fig:beautiful}
	\end{center}
\end{figure*}
