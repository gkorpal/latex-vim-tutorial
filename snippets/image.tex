% By default, figures appear in the most space-saving spot.
% You can change this behaviour by specifying an option between brackets after \begin{figure}:
%	'h' puts them (approximately) where you assign them.
%	't' puts them at the top.
%	'b' puts them at the bottom.
%	'p' puts them on their own page.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		% You can specify the size of the image by setting 'width=' or 'height='
		% The size can be set absolutely (in px, cm, etc.), relatively (with 'scale=1.5') or relative to \textwidth, like done below
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image.png}
		\caption{A very beautiful image.}
		\label{fig:beautiful}
	\end{center}
